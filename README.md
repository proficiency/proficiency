## Hello, world!
I'm Annie! I'm a 23 y/o developer that's worked mostly in freelance. This Github is mostly about Rust, C++, Python, or occasionally Assembly. a lot of my projects have something to do with a game, and there's also one or two repos about reverse engineering electronics.

#### Recent projects:
