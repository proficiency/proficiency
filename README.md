## hello, world!
i'm annie! this is a github mostly about C++ and Rust development. a lot of my projects have something to do with a game or just general software dev. there's also one or two repos about reverse engineering electronics. im a 22 y/o dev that's worked mostly in freelance and a little bit professionally. i also have a few passion projects that i've worked on for years which i hope will see the light of day soon. in terms of languages you can find projects on my github mostly in C++, Rust, and occasionally assembly or python.

here's a brief description of some of my recent projects:
* [hexen](https://github.com/proficiency/hexen)
 hexen is a hexagonal grid shaped-based RTS combat game, it's gimmick is a modern entity component system which allows large unit counts.
* [committer](https://github.com/proficiency/committer)
  silly rust 'hello, world!' project that commits to github. also uses json. 
* [ffresize](https://github.com/proficiency/ffresize)
  small python script that resizes videos to a given size with ffmpeg.
* **[ironsides](https://github.com/proficiency/ironsides/)**

* [teensy NES controller](https://github.com/proficiency/teensy_nes_controller)
