## hello, world!
i'm annie! this is a github mostly about C++ and Rust development. a lot of my projects have something to do with a game or just general software dev. there's also one or two repos about reverse engineering electronics. im a 22 y/o dev that's worked mostly in freelance and a little bit professionally. i also have a few passion projects that i've worked on for years which i hope will see the light of day soon. in terms of languages you can find projects on my github mostly in C++, Rust, and occasionally assembly or python.

here's a brief description of some of my recent projects:
* (https://github.com/proficiency/hexen)[hexen]
hexen is a hexagonal grid shaped-based RTS combat game, it's gimmick is a modern entity component system which allows large unit counts.
