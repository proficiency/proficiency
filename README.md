## Hello, world!
I'm Annie! I'm a 23 year old developer. This Github is mostly about Rust, C++, Python, or occasionally Assembly. a lot of my projects have something to do with a game, and there's also one or two repos about reverse-engineering electronics. Profile picture is currently ['Pleiades from Planet Earth'](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap251101.html) by [Max Inwood](https://www.instagram.com/max.nti/).
