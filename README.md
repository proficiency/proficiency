## hello, world!
i'm annie! this github is mostly about Rust and C++ development. a lot of my projects have something to do with a game or just general software dev. there's also one or two repos about reverse engineering electronics. i'm a 22 y/o dev that's worked mostly in freelance and a little bit professionally. i also have a few passion projects that i've worked on for years which i hope will see the light of day soon. in terms of languages you can find projects on my github mostly in Rust, C++, and occasionally assembly or python.

here's a brief description of some of my recent projects:
* **[hexen](https://github.com/proficiency/hexen)**
  RTS combat game that takes place on a hexagonal grid. it's gimmick is a modern entity-component system that allows large unit counts while remaining performant.
* **[committer](https://github.com/proficiency/committer)**
  silly rust 'hello, world!' project that commits to github. also uses json. 
* **[ffresize](https://github.com/proficiency/ffresize)**
  small python script that resizes videos to a given size with ffmpeg.
* **[ironsides](https://github.com/proficiency/ironsides/)**
naval combat game written in C++. 
* **[teensy NES controller](https://github.com/proficiency/teensy_nes_controller)**
  electronics project where you convert an old NES controller to work with usb by using a teensy microcontroller.
* **[rope demo](https://github.com/proficiency/rope_demo)**
  demo that shows off [Jakobsen softbody physics](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-s13/www/lec_slides/Jakobsen.pdf) in the form of a rope, has some shapes floating around to collide the rope with.
